# Project-RHX
An open-source console platform built by gamers, for gamers.
# XiroOS

### 💻 A custom bootable OS built from scratch, by a 16-year-old with a vision (and no engineering degree)

This isn’t a finished project.  
This isn’t a polished distro.  
This is a learning journey—documented in real time—for anyone who’s ever wanted to build something big but didn’t know where to start.

## 🚧 What is XiroOS?

XiroOS is a custom operating system built on top of a **base OS** (currently using **Ubuntu** for simplicity and compatibility). The idea is to create a community-driven, open-source OS that is customizable, easy to build upon, and built with developers and creators in mind.

It’s not just an OS—it’s the foundation for the **RHX ecosystem**. The goal is to give developers, artists, game creators, and anyone with a vision the tools they need to build on top of XiroOS, creating everything from unique UIs to full-fledged games. Eventually, there will be a store-like page for devs and artists to share their work, making XiroOS not just a system, but a living, breathing community.

Right now, the goal is simple:
- Boot the system into a kernel
- Display readable text
- Accept keyboard input
- Build an actual interface layer by layer

## 🧠 Who's Behind This?

Me.  
**DawnnyWanny**, a 16-year old with a love for tech, gaming, and custom OS concepts.  
I’m not a software engineer.  
I’ve never built an OS before.  
I’m figuring it out as I go—and I’m not afraid to say it.

## ✊ Why I'm Doing This

I’ve always had a vision for a custom console and ecosystem—but before any of that, I realized I needed the foundation: **an OS I fully control.**  
This repo is my way of building that from the ground up, and hopefully inspiring a few others to follow along. The bigger picture is RHX—a platform where creators can share their work, build games, design UIs, and contribute to an open-source environment. This is just the first step.

## 💬 Real Talk

I already know some people gon’ say:  
> “You’re too young.”  
> “This ain’t gonna work.”  
> “Nobody’s gonna help you.”  
> “Keep dreaming.”

Cool.  
Say what you want—I’m still gonna build it better yet WE (yes YOU if you plan to help) are going to build it 
This is for the people who actually give a shit about learning, building, and maybe helping someone else level up along the way.

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- Proper input handling via PS/2 keyboard driver
- File system setup
- Rendering a simple graphical UI (eventually)

---

## 🧪 Wanna Help?

If you:
- Know C or low-level systems stuff
- Have worked on kernels before
- Wanna help someone learn
- Just bored and down to debug

Then fork this repo, drop an issue, or just watch the project and see what comes of it.

## 📚 Dev Notes / Logs

Check the `/dev-logs/` folder for weekly updates, progress reports, and dumb bugs I ran into.
or I may make a channel on YT or Discord for it to document stuff

## 📌 Roadmap (Very Loosely Laid Out)

- [ ] Bootable GRUB config
- [ ] Hello world from kernel
- [ ] Keyboard input
- [ ] Screen clearing + better text layout
- [ ] Basic window rendering
- [ ] Custom graphical shell
- [ ] UI theming system
- [ ] Build into full shell-based desktop OS
- [ ] A Bootable ISO for everyone to use

No hype. No cap. Just code.  
Let’s see where this goes.
